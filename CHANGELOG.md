# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-05

### ⚠ Breaking Changes
* **Architecture Overhaul:** Complete rewrite implementing the "Active Record over AMQP" philosophy. The framework now simulates a RESTful architecture where messages contain "URLs" (via `type` header) that map to Controllers.
* **Resource Configuration:** Removed `routing_key_prefix` in favor of `resource_name`. By default, `resource_name` is now automatically pluralized (Rails-style) to determine routing keys and headers.
* **Schema-less Resources:** Removed strict `ActiveModel::Attributes` dependency. `BugBunny::Resource` no longer requires defining attributes manually. It now uses a dynamic storage (`@remote_attributes`) supporting arbitrary keys (including PascalCase for Docker APIs) via `method_missing`.

### 🚀 New Features
* **Middleware Stack:** Implemented an "Onion Architecture" for the `Client` similar to Faraday. Added support for middleware chains to intercept requests/responses.
    * `Middleware::JsonResponse`: Automatically parses JSON bodies and provides `IndifferentAccess`.
    * `Middleware::RaiseError`: Maps AMQP/HTTP status codes to Ruby exceptions (e.g., 404 to `BugBunny::NotFound`).
* **REST-over-AMQP Routing:** The `Consumer` now parses the `type` header as a URL (e.g., `users/show/12?active=true`) to dispatch actions to specific Controllers.
* **Direct Reply-To RPC:** Optimized RPC calls to use RabbitMQ's native `amq.rabbitmq.reply-to` feature, eliminating the need for temporary reply queues and improving performance.
* **Config Inheritance:** `BugBunny::Resource` configurations (like `connection_pool`, `exchange`) are now inherited by child classes, simplifying setup for groups of models.

### 🛠 Improvements
* **Connection Pooling:** Full integration with `connection_pool` to ensure thread safety in multi-threaded environments (Puma/Sidekiq).
* **Error Handling:** Unified exception hierarchy under `BugBunny::Error`, with specific classes for Client (4xx) and Server (5xx) errors.
* **Rails Integration:** Added `Railtie` with hooks for Puma and Spring to safely handle connection forks.
* **Documentation:** Added comprehensive YARD documentation for all core classes.
